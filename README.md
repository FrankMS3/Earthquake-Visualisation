The GeoJSON data used is retrieved from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website, available [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). Specifically, the dataset visualised here contains data on all recorded earthquakes over the past 7 days.  
  
The website visualises the dataset listed above, displaying each recorded earthquake as a circular marker on top of a map, showing the geographic location at which each earthquake occurred. The size of the markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake, while the colour reflects the depth. A legend is displayed in the lower right, providing info regarding the colour scale used for depth. When any marker is clicked on, a popup will appear above it, which will provide further information about the selected earthquake. The earthquake markers can be toggled on and off by using the menu in the upper right corner. This menu also allows for switching between a street map and a topographic map view.
